Invisibility cloak using OpenCV
Invisibility cloak works by removing the foreground of an image and replacing it with the background. This gives a perception of a invisibility cloak being created. This process of removing the foreground is the opposite of a green screen which removes the background of a video.
The following algorithm is followed:
1. First the background is captured and stored.
2. The colour of the cloak is defined by the upper and lower range of the colour in hsv form.
3. The cloak is then segmented out by generating a mask.
4. The final output is generated by combining the mask.
HSV ie hue saturation and value is another method of representing a colour, where Hue encodes color information, it can be thought of as an angle where 0 degrees = Red 120 degrees = Green and 240 degrees = Blue, Saturation is the intensity of the colour and Value is the brightness. 
Masking is the process of separating out the part of the image we are interested in from the rest of the image. After masking out the cloth we replace it with the background from the static video and our invisibility cloak is completed.
